PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Task: Create a flu awareness and prevention campaign for the state of California
Focus: Analyze flu data for California between the years of 2014-2018

GOALS:

  1) When should we launch the flu vaccination awareness campaign?
  2) Where should we target the campaign? 
  3) Which demographics should be our primary audience?

DATA SOURCES:
  
  1) Center of Disease Control (CDC)
  2) California Health and Human Service (CHHS)

DISCLAIMERS:

  1) Vaccination Data from CDC was collected via a phone survey Not everyone picked up Self-survey
  2) Contraction Data excluded  data from labs that serviced both Upper and Lower Southern California. 
     Only included labs that exclusively served one
  3) Vaccination Data was collected early in flu season, so the true vaccination rate by the end of the season could’ve been higher
  4) Many people (especially within ages 18-49) contract the flu but do not report it

RECOMMENDATIONS:

 1) Start Flu Vaccination Campaign in late summer - early fall (July - September)
 2) Target Southern California (Los Angeles,, San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino)
 3) Although everyone needs to be vaccinated more, this campaign will focus more on: Black and White communities and Ages 18-49
